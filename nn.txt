Neural networks are parallel computing devices, which is basically an attempt to make a computer model of the brain. The main objective is to develop a system to perform various computational tasks faster than the traditional systems. These tasks include pattern recognition and classification, approximation, optimization, and data clustering. Artificial Neural Network ANN is an efficient computing system whose central theme is borrowed from the analogy of biological neural networks. ANN are also named as artificial neural systems, or parallel distributed processing systems, or connectionist systems. ANN acquires a large collection of units that are interconnected in some pattern to allow communication between the units. These units, also referred to as nodes or neurons, are simple processors which operate in parallel. Every neuron is connected with other neuron through a connection link. Each connection link is associated with a weight that has information about the input signal. This is the most useful information for neurons to solve a particular problem because the weight usually excites or inhibits the signal that is being communicated. Each neuron has an internal state, which is called an activation signal. Output signals, which are produced after combining the input signals and activation rule, may be sent to other units.
